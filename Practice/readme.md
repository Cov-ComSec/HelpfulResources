- HTB - [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)
- THM - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- [VulnHub](vulnhub.com/)
- [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com)
- [ImmersiveLabs](https://immersivelabs.online/)*
- VHL - [Virtual Hacking Labs](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/)

- [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org)
- [IO](https://io.netgarage.org/)
- [pwncollege](https://pwn.college/)

***Immersive labs** is paid but while you are a student you have free access to it. 

Is hard to say which one is the best for you, but for starters we advice people to use either TryHackMe, PicoCTF or OTW. The three were designed for that purpose and have easy learning curve. We these three websites you can go from zero to hero, if you put a good amount of hours daily.

There are lot more places to practice and websites like [ctftime](https://ctftime.org) which is the website used for ranking all the ctfteams around the world and were most competitions are published if you want to participate in a good part of them you need an account.
