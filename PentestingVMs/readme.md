To begin hacking, we reccomend that you use a VM (Virtual Machine)
There are three main ways to run VMs:
- HyperV (Windows 10 Pro/Edu only) - [free licence with university](https://coventry.onthehub.com/)
- VirtualBox - [website](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- VMware - [free pro licence with university](https://coventry.onthehub.com/)

I personally use and **reccomend** VMware!

In terms of VM's there are three main ones that students use:
- Kali - [website](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
- Parrot OS - [website](https://www.parrotsec.org/security-edition/)
- CUEHali - Coventry Universities [forked version of Kali](https://cueh.coventry.ac.uk/vmrepo/)

I personally use and **reccomend** Kali!

Most students run the pure Kali version

Latest developments - WSL:
- Windows Sub System for Linux
- Can run a Kali GUI (using Win-Kex)
- Map network drives
Please bare in mind that WSL is not as sandboxed as running a pure VM (e.g. easier to pivot from linux to windows)
