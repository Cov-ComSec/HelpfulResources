To begin hacking, we reccomend that you use a VM (Virtual Machine)
There are three main ways to run VMs:
- HyperV (Windows 10 Pro/Edu only)
- VirtualBox
- VMware

I personally use VMware (where students can gain a free licence from [onthehub](https://coventry.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx)

In terms of VM's there are three main ones that students use:
- Kali
- Parrot OS
- CUEHali - Coventry Universities forked version of Kali

Most students run the pure Kali version

Latest developments - WSL:
- Windows Sub System for Linux
- Can run a Kali GUI (using Win-Kex)
- Map network drives
Please bare in mind that WSL is not as sandboxed as running a pure VM (e.g. easier to pivot from linux to windows)
