To begin hacking, we recommend that you use a VM (Virtual Machine)
There are four main ways to run VMs:
- HyperV (Windows 10 Pro/Edu only)
- VirtualBox
- VMware
- KVM/Qemu (really good for linux users)

We **recommend** everyone to use VMWare if they have the opportunity.

As coventry University Students we can get a free license of VMWare Pro [onthehub](https://coventry.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx)

In terms of VM's there are two main ones that students use:
- Kali
- Parrot OS

Most students run the pure Kali version

Latest developments - WSL:
- Windows Sub System for Linux
- Can run a Kali GUI (using Win-Kex)
- Map network drives
Please bare in mind that WSL is not as sandboxed as running a pure VM (e.g. easier to pivot from linux to windows)
