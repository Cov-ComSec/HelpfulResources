# Note Taking Tools
For note taking, all the committee uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - which is a language that is fantastic for transferring between different formats. Here are our top markdown editors:
- [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/) (installed by default in Kali)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
- [Notable](https://notable.app/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- A vim, VScode, Emacs or [insert your favourite text editor] works as well.

If you prefer a more tradition/GUI approach, have a look at:
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) - installed by default on Windows/with Microsoft Office; there is also a web version available
